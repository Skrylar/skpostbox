= Overview
Postboxes have a few parts:

Letter:: An object that will be later stored in to a mailbox.
Envelope:: A variant object which holds different kinds of letters.
Pontoon:: A `ref` object; it holds a list of unprocessed envelopes and a dead-man trigger.
Postbox:: A handle which is a unique pointer to protect the pontoon.
Deliverer:: An object who wraps letters in envelopes and leave them in postboxes.

[NOTE]
====
Postboxes are strictly *single owner*. They cannot be copied, only moved.

Also when the postbox is destroyed the pontoons are marked as `Disposed` so no more
messages can be processed. This creates the standard "weak reference" pattern.
Event senders are expected to lazily remove deliverers with dead pontoons as they
attempt to send events.
